        <p>
            The hummingbird hawk-moth is a species of hawk moth found across
            temperate regions of Eurasia. The species is named for its
            similarity to hummingbirds, as they feed on the nectar of
            tube-shaped flowers using their long proboscis while
            hovering in the air; this resemblance is an example of
            convergent evolution.

                The Eiffel Tower can be 15 cm taller during the summer, due

                Merle Robbins <b>(September 12, 1911 – January 14, 1984)</b>
                was an American barber from Reading, Ohio, who invented the card
                game UNO. In 1971, he invented UNO to resolve an argument
                with his son Ray, a teacher, about the rules of Crazy Eights.
                The original decks were designed and made on the family dining

                Charles B. Darrow of Germantown, PA created the game known

                Between the world wars, pianist Anthony Pratt enjoyed the

                hotels where he worked. In 1943 Pratt and his wife Elva

                In the early 1940s, when the dreaded disease polio struck 
                thousands of Americans, Eleanor Abbott, a victim of the disease,
                sought to invent pastimes for children who were recuperating. 
                Her most successful idea became Candy Land, a game many people 
                remember fondly as the first board game they ever played.
