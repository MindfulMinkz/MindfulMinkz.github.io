                <p>A fan wiki for the horror project <b>"Welcome Home"</b>,

            This wiki will often contain images, video, audio, or other content
            that could be considered disturbing. Trigger warnings include gore,
            derealization, alternate realities, eye strain, flashing images,
            loud noises, body horror, death, etc.
        </p>
        <p>This wiki will contain both spoilers and extra-canon materials, 
            such as concept art.
        </p>
        <p>
            The wiki is NOT an official site owned by Clown, and all content 
            is unaffiliated with their work. New content will only appear 
            from the original website! This is just a fan collaborative 
            database dedicated to the Welcome Home project that tries to 
            document as much information as possible about Clown's work, 
            made by fans and for fans.
