    <h3>Frank</h3>
    <p>“Arguably the smartest neighbor in Welcome Home, Frank Frankly is the 
        resident bookworm with an expertise on butterflies. Despite being 
        the grumpiest and greyest of this colorful cavalcade of neighbors,
        it’s good to have someone so organized and matter-of-fact amidst the 
        bunch. After all, he enjoys being frank, even if it means being 
        Frank, whatever that means! He is Julie’s best friend.”
