        <h2>The Neighborhood</h2>
        <p>
            Home is where the heart is, and Welcome Home’s residents are the 
            heart of its neighborhood! Even if you don’t live there, you’re 
            still one of its most important residents! But don’t worry — with 
            the help of this colorful array of neighbors, it’ll feel just like
            home in no time at all!
        </p>
    <img src="images/NewMapOut.png" width="500"> 
    <h3 id="W">Wally</h3>
    <p>“Wally Darling is the friendliest neighbor in Welcome Home, and perhaps 
        even the best painter, too. With a smile like his, it’s hard to 
        disagree! Always eager to make new friends and show them around the
        neighborhood, Wally is happy to lend a helping hand. But you already
        knew that, didn’t you?”
    </p>
    <h3 id="f">Frank</h3>
    <p>“Arguably the smartest neighbor in Welcome Home, Frank Frankly is the 
        resident bookworm with an expertise on butterflies. Despite being 
        the grumpiest and greyest of this colorful cavalcade of neighbors,
        it’s good to have someone so organized and matter-of-fact amidst the 
        bunch. After all, he enjoys being frank, even if it means being 
        Frank, whatever that means! He is Julie’s best friend.”
    </p>
    <h3 id="j">Julie</h3>
    <p>“Undoubtedly the cheeriest neighbor a puppet could ask for, Julie Joyful
         is Welcome Home’s happiest resident. Amidst such a rainbow of brightly
          colored neighbors, that’s really saying something! Upbeat, silly, 
          and always ready to play with her friends, there’s never a boring 
          day in Welcome Home when Julie’s around. She is Frank’s best friend.”
    </p>
    <h3 id="s">Sally</h3>
    <p>“The most rambunctious resident in Welcome Home, Sally Starlet shines 
        above the rest. She’s a firecracker who is willing to let her 
        imagination run wild in the name of a new adventure, albeit at 
        the occasional expense of her more cautious neighbors. Thankfully, 
        she’s got a good head on her shoulders, and perhaps one might say 
        a sunny disposition to match!”
    </p>
    <h3 id="p">Poppy</h3>
    <p>“Perhaps the most frantic, frazzled, and feathered neighbor in Welcome
        Home, Poppy Partridge is the resident chicken, so to speak. From a 
        sprained beak to sunburned feathers, she always thinks of the worst 
        outcome to a pleasant situation. Then again, it never hurts to have
        a neighbor with a first aid kit on hand.”
    </p>
    <h3 id="e">Eddie</h3>
    <p>“Reliable, kind, and ever determined, Eddie Dear is the best mailman
         Welcome Home has ever had, albeit the only one. Despite being a bit 
         of a clumsy and forgetful fellow, Eddie loves his job and always 
         manages to deliver everyone’s mail right on schedule.”
    </p>
    <h3 id="h">Howdy</h3>
    <p>“Howdy Pillar is Welcome Home’s friendliest and happiest shopkeeper! 
        This colorful caterpillar knows his store like the back of his hands,
        which is impressive considering how many he has. Charismatic, 
        quick-witted, and remarkably jolly, Howdy always seems to have
        whatever his neighbors need with a price that just can’t be beat!”
    </p>
    <h3 id="b">Barnaby</h3>
    <p>“A goofy layabout with a love for jokes, Barnaby B. Beagle is Welcome 
        Home’s funniest neighbor. Always ready with a joke on hand or even 
        just a silly observation, this big blue beagle always knows how to 
        have fun, much to the dismay of some of Home’s grumpier residents.”
