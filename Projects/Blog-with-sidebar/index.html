            Home is where the heart is, and Welcome Home’s residents are the 
            heart of its neighborhood! Even if you don’t live there, you’re 
            still one of its most important residents! But don’t worry — with 
            the help of this colorful array of neighbors, it’ll feel just like
            home in no time at all!
        </p>
    <img src="images/Neighborhood.jpg" width="500"> 
    <h3 id="W">Wally</h3>
    <p>“Wally Darling is the friendliest neighbor in Welcome Home, and perhaps 
        even the best painter, too. With a smile like his, it’s hard to 
        disagree! Always eager to make new friends and show them around the
        neighborhood, Wally is happy to lend a helping hand. But you already
        knew that, didn’t you?”
    </p>
    <h3 id="f">Frank</h3>
    <p>“Arguably the smartest neighbor in Welcome Home, Frank Frankly is the 
        resident bookworm with an expertise on butterflies. Despite being 
        the grumpiest and greyest of this colorful cavalcade of neighbors,
        it’s good to have someone so organized and matter-of-fact amidst the 
        bunch. After all, he enjoys being frank, even if it means being 
        Frank, whatever that means! He is Julie’s best friend.”
    </p>
    <h3 id="j">Julie</h3>
    <p>“Undoubtedly the cheeriest neighbor a puppet could ask for, Julie Joyful
         is Welcome Home’s happiest resident. Amidst such a rainbow of brightly
          colored neighbors, that’s really saying something! Upbeat, silly, 
          and always ready to play with her friends, there’s never a boring 
          day in Welcome Home when Julie’s around. She is Frank’s best friend.”
    </p>
    <h3 id="s">Sally</h3>
    <p>“The most rambunctious resident in Welcome Home, Sally Starlet shines 
        above the rest. She’s a firecracker who is willing to let her 
        imagination run wild in the name of a new adventure, albeit at 
        the occasional expense of her more cautious neighbors. Thankfully, 
        she’s got a good head on her shoulders, and perhaps one might say 
        a sunny disposition to match!”
    </p>
    <h3 id="p">Poppy</h3>
    <p>“Perhaps the most frantic, frazzled, and feathered neighbor in Welcome
        Home, Poppy Partridge is the resident chicken, so to speak. From a 
        sprained beak to sunburned feathers, she always thinks of the worst 
        outcome to a pleasant situation. Then again, it never hurts to have
        a neighbor with a first aid kit on hand.”
    </p>
    <h3 id="e">Eddie</h3>
    <p>“Reliable, kind, and ever determined, Eddie Dear is the best mailman
         Welcome Home has ever had, albeit the only one. Despite being a bit 
         of a clumsy and forgetful fellow, Eddie loves his job and always 
         manages to deliver everyone’s mail right on schedule.”
    </p>
    <h3 id="h">Howdy</h3>
    <p>“Howdy Pillar is Welcome Home’s friendliest and happiest shopkeeper! 
        This colorful caterpillar knows his store like the back of his hands,
        which is impressive considering how many he has. Charismatic, 
        quick-witted, and remarkably jolly, Howdy always seems to have
        whatever his neighbors need with a price that just can’t be beat!”
    </p>
    <h3 id="b">Barnaby</h3>
    <p>“A goofy layabout with a love for jokes, Barnaby B. Beagle is Welcome 
        Home’s funniest neighbor. Always ready with a joke on hand or even 
        just a silly observation, this big blue beagle always knows how to 
        have fun, much to the dismay of some of Home’s grumpier residents.”

    <p id="ma">
        HOWDY: Howdy-do, fellas! What can I get for you two today?

BARNABY: Hiya Howdy, I think we’re gonna enjoy ourselves the usual.
<br>
HOWDY: A usual for my usuals? Comin’ right up, pal-ly!
<br>
WALLY: The usual? I thought we were getting hot dogs.
<br>
BARNABY: That is our usual, little buddy, it means somethin’ you and me get 
all the time! Kinda like our morning perusal.
<br>
WALLY: You mean our walk?
<br>
BARNABY: Yeah, but I like perusal better! Makes me feel like a fancy, high-class
 pooch! A pedigree with some degrees, if you will.
<br>
WALLY: Oh.
<br>
HOWDY: Alrighty! I gotta bloodhound in a whirlwind of trouble and an old 
reliable dog! So what’s the gaff today, Barn?
<br>
BARNABY: I got a good one that’s been brewin’ in this pot of mine all day!
 What do you call a caterpillar after a month-long nap? A butterfly! But if
  you ask me, I’d call the poor guy a doctor!
<br>
[Howdy laughs comically and over the top, slapping the counter. Wally laughs 
too, announcing the words, “ha ha ha,” out loud.]
<br>
HOWDY: That’s a hoot! A holler even! You always never disappoint! Say, Wally, 
what about you? You got any silly yarns for me today?
<br>
WALLY: No, but I have a joke.
<br>
[Howdy laughs again, shaking his head.]
<br>
BARNABY: What’d I tell you? He’s a natural and that was just a taste! Go on, 
kid.
<br>
WALLY: Okay. How does Barnaby eat his hot dog?
<br>
HOWDY: How?
<br>
WALLY: He relishes it!
<br>
[Howdy laughs heartily as he did the first time, slapping the counter top. 
Barnaby laughs too.]
<br>
HOWDY: He sure does! Boy, you’re getting the hang of this funny business, Walls!
 It won’t be long before you’re the one paying for these hot dogs!
<br>
WALLY: That’s okay, I like when Barnaby buys them.
<br>
BARNABY: It’s like ya said, Howdy, we’re a couple’a usuals who know what we 
like.

    JULIE: [Excitedly and quickly] Frank, Frank, Frank! Oh Frank, won’t you 
    play a game with me?
<br>
FRANK: Oh, Julie, good morning. No, I can’t right now. I’m watering my plants, 
see?
<br>
JULIE: I do see! I hear them too! Gee, they sure have a lot to say!
<br>
FRANK: [Baffled] What? My Sole and Lyco? What are they saying to you?!
<br>
JULIE: [Interrupting him.] Oh, ssh, ssh! Hold on just a second, Frank! They’re
 telling me right now! ….Mhm… Uh-huh… Oh? Oh! I see- Oh, you don’t say!
<br>
[Julie continues to speak to the plants through affirmative sounds. Frank 
nervously mumbles and tuts from behind her.]
<br>
FRANK: Well? What did they say?
<br>
JULIE: Your tomatoes think you have a very love-o-ly bowtie today!
<br>
FRANK: They do?-
<br>
[Frank stops mid-sentence to lean towards the tomatoes and mumble a soft,
 “thank you,” before returning his attention to Julie.]
<br>
FRANK: What else are they saying?
<br>
JULIE: Well- they also think your marigolds could be a little merrier! But I 
wouldn’t say that in front of your flowers!
<br>
[Frank pauses again to look at his tomatoes, this time mumbling, “I’m sorry, 
I’ll see what I can do.”]
<br>
JULIE: They also had one last thing to say…. They think… That you’ve done such 
a good job gardening… That you should go play jump rope with Julie to celebrate!
<br>
[Frank sighs loudly in exasperation as Julie laughs.]
<br>
FRANK: [Distressed.] Oh Julie! You were fibbing about the tomatoes telling
 you all that, weren’t you!?
<br>
JULIE: No, Frank, I was telling the truth! Honest! Your marigolds really are 
very, very rude!

    EDDIE: Mail call! I got mail here for Ms. Partridge!
<br>
SALLY: I’ll be taking that!
<br>
EDDIE: Pardon me for askin’ but-
<br>
SALLY: You’re pardoned.
<br>
EDDIE: Well, I could have sworn this was Poppy’s barn! I might’ve made a wrong 
turn at that game of hopscotch outside of Julie’s house! Those games always get me turned around…
<br>
SALLY: Of course this is her barn, mailman! But she just so happens to have her 
feathers full at the moment!
<br>
POPPY: Hello, dearie! I’m right here- At least, I think I am- Oh goodness, it’s
 hard to see past all this yarn!
<br>
EDDIE: [Mumbled] Oh darlin’, what has she got you wearing?
<br>
SALLY: Can’t you see she is a beautiful beanstalk? The perfect outfit for the 
star of my next play!
<br>
POPPY: Oh yes! I forgot to ask what role this is for… It was a bit sprung on me.
<br>
SALLY: It is for Jack and the Beanstalk, obviously! But I have taken some 
artistic liberties of course- I call this rendition- wait for it- Sally and the Beanstalk!
<br>
EDDIE: Oh boy…. So Sally and the Beanstalk is a little like that story about 
that fella who traded some cows for a couple’a beans? The same beans that eventually grow into a giant beanstalk he decides to climb up?
<br>
SALLY: Yes!
<br>
POPPY: [Whispering fearfully] …Climbed…?
<br>
EDDIE: And then he runs into that big and mean ol’ giant at the top? The very 
same who chases after Jack all the way to the bottom?
<br>
SALLY: Yes, yes!
<br>
POPPY: [Whispering even more frantically] …G-Giant…?!
<br>
EDDIE: And when Jack gets to the bottom, doesn’t he cut down that beanstalk 
with a big axe?
<br>
SALLY: Yes, yes, that’s exactly it! But it will be yours truly as the one with 
the big axe instead!
<br>
POPPY: [Louder and afraid] Big axe?!
<br>
[Poppy lets out a dramatic squawk and faints with a loud thud.]
<br>
SALLY: Oh Poppy, don’t worry! After some rehearsals, you will feel as strong
 and sturdy as the role you were born to play!

<p>The Welcome Home Restoration Project is a team of anonymous individuals
    dedicated to compiling, restoring, and archiving what few remnants of 
    Welcome Home have been uncovered. It is through these collective efforts
    that we will awaken the memory of this lost piece of media. We strive
    to establish a friendly and open community of friends, family, and fans,
    just like the colorful and quaint neighbors in our beloved Home!
</p>

<p>
     ​Love is clear in the messages of Wally Darling and is as much of a
    hallmark to him as his charismatic smile, his cheery disposition,
    and his eagerness to understand the world around him. We too hope 
    to spread this feeling of everlasting joy, caring, understanding, 
    and acceptance to all in the hopes that you will join us in our 
    thorough exploration. Together, we will make this house a home!
</p>
<p>
    Visitors may wonder how we came to uncover such a show, where we obtained 
    these works, and the efforts taken to restore them to the best of our 
    ability. To that we are happy to open our front door to you, neighbor!
