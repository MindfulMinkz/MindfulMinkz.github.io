                    Like the original <i>Portal (2007) </i>, players solve puzzles 
                    by placing portals and teleporting between them. Portal 
                    2 adds features including tractor beams, lasers, light 
                    bridges, and paint-like gels that alter player movement 
                    or allow portals to be placed on any surface. In the 
                    single-player campaign, players control Chell, who navigates
                    the dilapidated Aperture Science Enrichment Center during
                    its reconstruction by the supercomputer GLaDOS 
                    (Ellen McLain); new characters include robot Wheatley 
                    (Stephen Merchant) and Aperture founder Cave Johnson 
                    (J. K. Simmons). In the new cooperative mode, players 
                    solve puzzles together as robots Atlas and P-Body 
                    (both voiced by Dee Bradley Baker). Jonathan Coulton
                    and the National produced songs for the game.

                    Valve announced Portal 2 in March 2010, and promoted it 
                    with alternate reality games including the Potato Sack,
                     a collaboration with several independent game developers. 
                     After release, Valve released downloadable content and a 
                     simplified map editor to allow players to create and 
                     share levels.

                    Portal 2 received critical acclaim for its gameplay,
                     balanced learning curve, pacing, dark humor, writing, 
                     and acting. Like its predecessor, it has been described 
                     as one of the greatest video games ever made by numerous
                      publications and critics.

                    Portal 2 is a first-person perspective puzzle game. The 
                    player takes the role of Chell in the single-player 
                    campaign, as one of two robots—ATLAS and P-Body—in the 
                    cooperative campaign, or as a simplistic humanoid icon 
                    in community-developed puzzles. Characters can withstand
                    limited damage but will die after sustained injury.<sup>
                    [2][3]</sup> 
                    The goal of both campaigns is to explore the Aperture
                    Science Laboratory—a complicated, malleable mechanized 
                    maze. While some parts of the game takes place in modular
                    test chambers with clearly defined entrances and exits,
                    other parts occur in behind-the-scenes areas where the
                    objective is less clear.

                    The initial tutorials guide the player through movement 
                    controls and interactions with their environment, and in 
                    the case of the cooperative campaign, interactions with 
                    the other player. Gameplay revolves around the use of 
                    the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, which can 
                    create a pair of two portals on suitable surfaces through
                    which the player or objects can pass through. Characters 
                    can use these portals to move between rooms or to 
                    "fling" objects or themselves across a distance.<sup>[4][5]
                    </sup>
                <br>
                <br>
                    Additional game elements not featured in the original Portal 
                    include Thermal Discouragement Beams (lasers),
                    Excursion Funnels (tractor beams), and Hard Light Bridges,
                    all of which can be transmitted through portals.<sup>
                    [2][6][7][8]</sup>
                    Aerial Faith Plates catapult the player and objects through 
                    the air. The player must disable sentient, lethal turrets or 
                    avoid their line of sight. The Weighted Storage Cube has
                    been redesigned, and there are new types: Redirection Cubes, 
                    which have prismatic lenses that redirect laser beams, 
                    spherical Edgeless Safety Cubes, an antique version of the
                    Weighted Storage Cube used in the underground levels, and
                    a cube-turret hybrid created by Wheatley after taking 
                    ontrol of Aperture.[2][9] The heart-decorated Weighted
                    Companion Cube appears briefly.[10] Early demonstrations
                    included Pneumatic Diversity Vents, shown to transport 
                    objects and transfer suction power through portals, but
                    these do not appear in the final game.<sup>[2][9][11][12]
                    </sup> 
                    The typical objective of a test chamber or level is to 
                    use the portal gun and provided gameplay elements to 
                    open a locked exit door and progress to the next chamber.

                    The Repulsion (jumping) and Propulsion (running) gels in
                    Portal 2 originated in Tag: The Power of Paint. Valve hired 
                    the Tag creators to develop the idea further and later 
                    decided to include it in Portal 2.<sup>[37]</sup> 
                    Journalists have 
                    likened Tag to Narbacular Drop, the DigiPen student project
                    whose mechanics became Portal.<sup>[56][57][58]</sup>
                     As the third Tag 
                     gel, which allows the character to walk on any surface
                    regardless of gravity, gave playtesters motion sickness, 
                    it was replaced by Conversion gel, which integrates with 
                    the portal mechanic.<sup>[59]</sup> The gels give the 
                    player more 
                    control over the environment, which increased the 
                    challenge for the puzzle designers.<sup>[51]</sup> The gels
                     are rendered using fluid dynamics routines specially 
                    developed at Valve by the former Tag Team.<sup>[11][23]
                    </sup> 
                    Rendering techniques developed for Left 4 Dead 2 were 
                    used to render pools of liquid; Portal 2 combines 
                    "flowing" surface maps to mimic the motion of water 
                    with "debris flow" maps and random noise to create 
                    realistic, real-time rendering of water effects.<sup>[60]
