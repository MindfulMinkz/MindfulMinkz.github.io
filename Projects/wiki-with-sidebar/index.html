                Portal 2</b> is a 2011 puzzle-platform game developed by
                Valve for Windows, macOS, Linux, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 
                360. The digital PC versions are distributed online by 
                Valve's Steam service, while all retail editions are 
                distributed by Electronic Arts. A port for the Nintendo 
                Switch was released as part of the Portal: Companion 
                Collection in June 2022.

                Like the original Portal (2007), players solve puzzles by
                 placing portals and teleporting between them. Portal 2 
                adds features including tractor beams, lasers, light 
                bridges, and paint-like gels that alter player movement 
                or allow portals to be placed on any surface. In the 
                single-player campaign, players control Chell, who 
                navigates the dilapidated Aperture Science Enrichment 
                Center during its reconstruction by the supercomputer 
                GLaDOS (Ellen McLain); new characters include robot 
                Wheatley (Stephen Merchant) and Aperture founder Cave 
                Johnson (J. K. Simmons). In the new cooperative mode, 
                players solve puzzles together as robots Atlas and P-Body
                (both voiced by Dee Bradley Baker). Jonathan Coulton and 
                the National produced songs for the game.

                Valve announced Portal 2 in March 2010, and promoted it 
                with alternate reality games including the Potato Sack, 
                a collaboration with several independent game developers.
                After release, Valve released downloadable content and a
                simplified map editor to allow players to create and
                share levels.
        </p>
        <p>
                Portal 2 received critical acclaim for its gameplay, 
                balanced learning curve, pacing, dark humor, writing,
                and acting. Like its predecessor, it has been described
                as one of the greatest video games ever made by numerous
                publications and critics.

        <p>
                Portal 2 is a first-person perspective puzzle game. 
                The player takes the role of Chell in the single-player 
                campaign, as one of two robots—ATLAS and P-Body—in the 
                cooperative campaign, or as a simplistic humanoid icon 
                in community-developed puzzles. Characters can withstand 
                limited damage but will die after sustained injury.<sup>
                [2][3]</sup>
                The goal of both campaigns is to explore the Aperture 
                Science Laboratory—a complicated, malleable mechanized 
                maze. While some parts of the game takes place in modular 
                test chambers with clearly defined entrances and exits, 
                other parts occur in behind-the-scenes areas where the 
                objective is less clear.
        </p>
        <p>
                The initial tutorials guide the player through movement 
                controls and interactions with their environment, and in 
                the case of the cooperative campaign, interactions with 
                the other player. Gameplay revolves around the use of the 
                Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, which can create 
                a pair of two portals on suitable surfaces through which 
                the player or objects can pass through. Characters can 
                use these portals to move between rooms or to "fling" 
                objects or themselves across a distance.<sup>[4][5]</sup>
        </p>
                
        <p>
                Additional game elements not featured in the original Portal 
                include Thermal Discouragement Beams (lasers),
                Excursion Funnels (tractor beams), and Hard Light Bridges,
                all of which can be transmitted through portals.<sup>
                [2][6][7][8]</sup>
                Aerial Faith Plates catapult the player and objects through 
                the air. The player must disable sentient, lethal turrets or 
                avoid their line of sight. The Weighted Storage Cube has
                been redesigned, and there are new types: Redirection Cubes, 
                which have prismatic lenses that redirect laser beams, 
                spherical Edgeless Safety Cubes, an antique version of the
                Weighted Storage Cube used in the underground levels, and
                a cube-turret hybrid created by Wheatley after taking 
                ontrol of Aperture.[2][9] The heart-decorated Weighted
                Companion Cube appears briefly.[10] Early demonstrations
                included Pneumatic Diversity Vents, shown to transport 
                objects and transfer suction power through portals, but
                these do not appear in the final game.<sup>[2][9][11][12]
                </sup> 
                The typical objective of a test chamber or level is to 
                use the portal gun and provided gameplay elements to 
                open a locked exit door and progress to the next chamber.
        </p>
        <p>
                The Repulsion (jumping) and Propulsion (running) gels in
                Portal 2 originated in Tag: The Power of Paint. Valve hired 
                the Tag creators to develop the idea further and later 
                decided to include it in Portal 2.<sup>[37]</sup> 
                Journalists have 
                likened Tag to Narbacular Drop, the DigiPen student project
                whose mechanics became Portal.<sup>[56][57][58]</sup>
                As the third Tag 
                gel, which allows the character to walk on any surface
                regardless of gravity, gave playtesters motion sickness, 
                it was replaced by Conversion gel, which integrates with 
                the portal mechanic.<sup>[59]</sup> The gels give the 
                player more 
                control over the environment, which increased the 
                challenge for the puzzle designers.<sup>[51]</sup> The gels
                are rendered using fluid dynamics routines specially 
                developed at Valve by the former Tag Team.<sup>[11][23]
                </sup> 
                Rendering techniques developed for Left 4 Dead 2 were 
                used to render pools of liquid; Portal 2 combines 
                "flowing" surface maps to mimic the motion of water 
                with "debris flow" maps and random noise to create 
                realistic, real-time rendering of water effects.<sup>[60]

                The Portal series shares a fictional universe with the 
                Half-Life series. The events in Portal take place between 
                the first and second Half-Life games,<sup>[21]</sup>
                while most of
                Portal 2 is set "a long time after" the events in Portal.
                <sup>[22]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
                Before Portal, Aperture Science conducted experiments to 
                determine whether human subjects could safely navigate
                dangerous "test chambers", until the artificial 
                intelligence GLaDOS, governing the laboratory, killed its
                employees. At the end of the first Portal, 
                the protagonist Chell destroys GLaDOS and momentarily
                escapes the facility, but is dragged back inside by an
                unseen figure later identified by writer Erik Wolpaw 
                as the "Party Escort Bot".<sup>[23]</sup> A promotional 
                comic shows estranged Aperture Science employee Doug 
                Rattmann, who used graffiti to guide the player
                in Portal, placing Chell into suspended animation 
                to save her life, until the beginning of Portal 2.

                <p>
                In the Aperture Science Enrichment Center, player-character
                Chell wakes in a stasis chamber resembling a motel room. 
                The complex has become dilapidated after what appears to 
                be millennia of decay. Wheatley (Stephen Merchant), a
                personality core, guides her through old test chambers 
                from the first game in an attempt to escape the facility 
                after its reserve power is depleted.<sup>[24][25]</sup>
                They accidentally reactivate the dormant GLaDOS 
                (Ellen McLain)<sup>[2]</sup> while attempting to restore 
                power to the escape pods; she separates Chell from 
                Wheatley and begins rebuilding the facility.<sup>[26][27]
                </sup>
        </p>

        <p>
                GLaDOS subjects Chell to new tests until Wheatley helps 
                her escape again. They sabotage Aperture's production 
                of turrets and neurotoxin to prevent GLaDOS from killing 
                them, then confront GLaDOS and perform a core transfer; 
                replacing her with Wheatley as the laboratory's controller.
                Wheatley, immediately driven mad with power, installs 
                GLaDOS on a potato battery. GLaDOS tells Chell that
                Wheatley was designed as an "intelligence dampening 
                sphere" to deliberately produce illogical thoughts 
                and hamper her own intelligence.<sup>[28]</sup>Infuriated,
                Wheatley inadvertently destroys the lift to the surface 
                with Chell and GLaDOS inside, causing them to fall to
                the facility's abandoned lowest levels.
        </p>

        <p>
                Chell retrieves the potato battery and they form a 
                reluctant partnership to stop Wheatley before his 
                incompetence destroys the facility. Ascending through 
                laboratories built in the 20th century, they discover 
                audio recordings by eccentric Aperture Science founder 
                Cave Johnson (J. K. Simmons).<sup>[29]</sup> The recordings
                reveal how Aperture slowly lost money and prestige 
                through out the decades, as its pool of test subjects was
                altered from "astronauts, war heroes, and Olympians" in the 
                1950s, to homeless people in the 1970s, and Aperture's 
                own employees in the 1980s. In 1981, Johnson became
                mortally ill after ingesting Moon dust used to 
                manufacture portal-conductive surfaces.<sup>[30]</sup> His last 
                request was for the mind of his assistant Caroline 
                (McLain) to be transferred—by force, if necessary—to 
                an advanced computer designed to store a human 
                consciousness, which he had previously commissioned 
                to save himself, creating GLaDOS. GLaDOS is troubled 
                by the discovery that she is Caroline.<sup>[30]</sup>
        </p>

        <p>Chell and GLaDOS return to Aperture's higher levels, 
                where they discover Wheatley's utter incompetence has 
                brought the Aperture facility on the verge of catastrophic
                failure.<sup>[31]<sup> Wheatley, after discovering Chell and 
                GLaDOS had returned, decides to keep them alive as test subjects
                because the "franken-turret" cubes he created were 
                ineffective at solving tests. GLaDOS later reveals that
                her body came built-in with a euphoric response to 
                test completion that becomes less effective over time. 
                Throughout the following chambers, Wheatley becomes 
                increasingly frustrated with its dwindling effects.<sup>[32]
                </sup>
        </p>

        <p>
                Wheatley reveals that he has a "surprise" for Chell and 
                GLaDOS, later tricking them into a death trap. He reveals
                that he had discovered the two robots from the Cooperative
                Testing Initiative, the game's cooperative campaign,
                making Chell no longer useful to him. She manages to
                escape from the trap right before its activation. 
                The game's final levels are spent escaping from 
                Wheatley's numerous attempts to kill them.<sup>[33]</sup>
        </p>

        <p>
                In the game's boss fight and ending, Chell confronts 
                Wheatley and attaches corrupted personality cores 
                (Nolan North)<sup>[34]</sup>to force another core exchange and 
                restore GLaDOS to authority. However, Wheatley demolishes 
                the button necessary to initiate the transfer. As the 
                facility crumbles, Chell places a portal on the Moon; 
                she and Wheatley begin to be pulled into the vacuum of 
                space. GLaDOS, having reasserted control over the facility,
                rescues Chell and abandons Wheatley to outer space.
                <sup>[35][33]</sup> When Chell awakens, GLaDOS claims to have 
                learned of humanity from the remnants of Caroline,<sup>[33]
                </sup>but deletes Caroline's personality.<sup>[36]</sup> 
                Deciding that Chell is not worth the trouble of killing, GLaDOS 
                frees her from the facility.<sup>[37]</sup>
        </p>
        <h3 id="co-op">Co-op</h3>
        <p>
                The cooperative story is chronologically set after the 
                events of the single-player campaign, but players are 
                not required to play them in order.<sup>[38]</sup> Player
                 charactersAtlas and P-Body are bipedal robots constructed by 
                GLaDOS. In the first four 'sets' of levels, the robots 
                are sent on ventures into the depths of the Aperture 
                facilities to recover and upload data disks. After 
                completion of each mission, the robots self-destruct 
                and are reassembled to complete the next.
        </p>

        <p>
                At first, GLaDOS is excited about her non-human test 
                subjects, but later becomes dissatisfied because the 
                two robots cannot truly die, and at one point also gets 
                uncomfortable with their close partnership.<sup>[39]</sup>
                At the end of the story, the robots gain entry to 
                "the Vault",a storage facility of thousands of humans placed in 
                stasis.<sup>[31]</sup> GLaDOS thanks the robots for their 
                acquisition of new test subjects, and promptly destroys 
                the robots. <sup>[39]</sup>
