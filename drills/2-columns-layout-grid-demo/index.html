                Like the original Portal (2007), players solve puzzles by
                 placing portals and teleporting between them. Portal 2 
                adds features including tractor beams, lasers, light 
                bridges, and paint-like gels that alter player movement 
                or allow portals to be placed on any surface. In the 
                single-player campaign, players control Chell, who 
                navigates the dilapidated Aperture Science Enrichment 
                Center during its reconstruction by the supercomputer 
                GLaDOS (Ellen McLain); new characters include robot 
                Wheatley (Stephen Merchant) and Aperture founder Cave 
                Johnson (J. K. Simmons). In the new cooperative mode, 
                players solve puzzles together as robots Atlas and P-Body
                (both voiced by Dee Bradley Baker). Jonathan Coulton and 
                the National produced songs for the game.
